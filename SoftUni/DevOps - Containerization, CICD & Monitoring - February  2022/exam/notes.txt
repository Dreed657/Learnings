Steps taken doing exam:

    !!! IP Address is different from one in the exam description
    because using linux host for virtaulbox which didn't let me use diffrent subnet

    Vagrant file order is not in 1..n order, because wanted to start 
    the monitoring service first to ensure that will take some 
    readings while another machines are loading.

    For quick startup and not waiting for virtualbox to start them one by one.
    grep config.vm.define Vagrantfile | awk -F'"' '{print $2}' | xargs -P3 -I {} vagrant up {}

    Setup vagrant:
        Base image: ubuntu 20.04
        Specs:
            Memory: 4g
            Cpus: 4 cores
        Hosts: pipelines.do1.exam, docker.do1.exam, monitoring.do1.exam
        Forwarded ports:
            Jenkins:
                Jenkins UI - 8081
            Docker:
                Application FE: 8080
            Monitoring:
                Grafana - 8082 
    
    Jenkins vm setup:
        Update hosts

        Install node_extractor
        Install jenkins, java
        Start setup-jenkins 
        Setup ssh access to docker vm (manually)
            su jenkins (pass: pass1)
            ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048
            cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
            exit
            vagrant ssh docker
            echo '<key>' >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
            exit
        Setup pipeline from Jenkins file in shared-files/jenkins/pipelines/

    Docker vm setup:
        Update hosts

        Install docker engine, client, docker-compose, java
        Create docker network "app-net"
        Start docker-compose for gitea
        Configure gitea

    Monitoring vm setup:
        Chosen solution: Prometheuos + Grafana

        Update hosts

        Install node_extractor
        Install prometheuos
        Install grafana
        Start systemctl services
        Add initial grafana user { user: exam, pass: exam }
        Update grafana provisioning
            Add datasource
            Add dashboards
